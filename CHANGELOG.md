# Changelog

Every release of Stuga, newest first, in the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
format. The release workflow reads this file ([RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md#the-changelog)): an entry
becomes its version's release notes, and its date and whether it has a **Security** section are what
a running node learns about the version.

An entry's **Upgrade notes** section says what someone running a node has to decide or do. Without
one, the release notes say there is nothing to do.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- The one-step Docker install (`curl … | bash`) stopped after "Stuga is running" without printing
  the link that creates the administrator account. On a node installed with 0.1.0, `./stuga status`
  prints that link.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-24

The first release.
